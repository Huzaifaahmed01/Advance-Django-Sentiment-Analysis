Yet more headache for the Trump admin..
Surprised?
This is actually very touching.
Donald Trump Jr. is facing new questions about what he knew prior to a meeting with a Russian lawyer last year. The New York Times is reporting that he received an email from the person setting up the meeting claiming it was part of a Russian Government effort to aid his Father's candidacy. Daily Wire's Ben Shapiro joins Dana Loesch to discuss.
Trump needs to listen to Gowdy.
Good for them.
Wow.
"""Some Californians are so serious about it, they‚Äôve petitioned their attorney general‚Äôs office to put it on the ballot."""
SHUT. DOWN.
"""This is, I believe, worse than what I thought..."""

"Today on LIVE with The Conservative Millennial & Lawrence Jones III: Donald Trump Jr., New York Times author David Brooks, Lena Dunham, and #AllAmericanPetPhotoDay."
"""The entire meeting was 'the most inane nonsense I ever heard. And I was actually agitated by it...'"""
"""Police investigators have suggested Brinton receive a written reprimand..."""
Always a double standard.
He wasn't messing around.
Such brazen hypocrisy.

Another ridiculous media criticism.
You can't make this stuff up.

The liberal narrative on climate change continues to unravel.
OUCH! That's definitely gonna leave a burn...
"""We‚Äôve also learned that [Trump] has no desire and no capacity to lead the world.."""

Mainly because they don't know history.
This sure doesn't look good.
Prayers for Steve Scalise.
CNN might be in trouble...
What's the line?
Trump is not letting up!
"‚ÄúSo hypersensitive about offending three people in the country..."""

Be sure to read Rev. Peterson's ""The Antidote: Healing America From the Poison of Hate, Blame and Victimhood."" Get it here --> http://amzn.to/2tIPrZ6. . For a half century or more, black people have labored under the spell of what Jesse Lee Peterson calls the alchemists. These are the race hustlers, media hacks, politicians, community organizers and the like who promise to fundamentally transform America. . . The transformation they promise, however, produces only fool s gold unearned benefits like welfare, food stamps, subsidized housing, payouts from lawsuits, and maybe one day even reparations. Worse, to secure these counterfeit goods, recipients have to sacrifice something of infinite value: the sanctity of the two-parent family. It is a devil s bargain. . . To make this experiment work, the alchemists have created an ungodly and unhealthy environment, one in which the white population is made to feel guilty and the black population made to feel angry. The pattern in this is simple: children black or white when deprived of fathers, grow up angry at their parents. White children displace their anger in a thousand different directions. Black children channel theirs, for the most part, in a single destructive direction towards and against white people. . . The alchemists encourage them to do this, enable them, and even reward them. This anger fuels the system and pays the alchemists bills. As bleak as this all sounds, an antidote exists, which saved Peterson s life, that of his son, and those of countless young men who have been counseled at Peterson s organization, BOND. The perverse genius of liberalism has been its ability to capture black anger and project it outwards towards anyone, black or white, who resists the Democratic agenda. . . By encouraging a resentful dependency, liberals have instituted a new kind of slavery in the black community as emotionally shackling as the physical slavery that first brought Africans to America. Peterson knows this story from the inside as few other people do. . . Born on an Alabama plantation, he was abandoned by his father before he was born. After high school, Peterson moved to Los Angeles and for the next twenty years moved purposelessly through life, channeling his internal anger outwards towards white people and America in general.

"‚ÄúDecision-making is fragmented, and sometimes people don‚Äôt want to take decisions.‚Äù"
With friends like these...
Attempting to undermine American democracy? Let bygones be bygones!
‚ÄúWhat they hate is that they feel like they‚Äôre losing on the terrain they believe is the only one that really matters.‚Äù
And political observers on both sides of the aisle question how scandal-ridden Kushner still has security clearance.
He accused activists of trying to bring about a religious purification through deportations and walls.

One rehab facility is alleged to have recruited addicts with gift cards and visits to strip clubs.

"‚ÄúI already know where you live, I‚Äôm on you. You might as well call me. You will see me. I promise. Bro.‚Äù"
"Oh, you meant THAT Russian lawyer meeting?"
She then proceeds to step behind Melania.
GOP moderates got thrown under the bus.
Trump probably hasn‚Äôt forgotten about that handshake back in May.
He also called 39-year-old Trump Jr. ‚Äúa wonderful young man.‚Äù
Marshall: ‚ÄúThe idea that the President believes this is a phony scandal manufactured by his enemies rests on the premise that he doesn‚Äôt think anything actually happened. And that is at this point a very dubious proposition.‚Äù
BREAKING
"The one-page document from the Department of Justice contains no detailed information, other than a check next to the ‚Äúno‚Äù box in response to a question asking about any contact with foreign governments in the past seven years."

"‚ÄúIf you get a call to go to a certain place in the middle of the night to pick up stolen goods and it turns out the stolen goods don‚Äôt show up, but the cops show up, I think you‚Äôre going to have a very weak story saying, ‚ÄòWell, I got swindled here.‚Äô‚Äù"
New tactic: Smear campaigns against the free press.
"‚ÄúTime and time and time again, they turn the other way. And they‚Äôre doing the same thing now.‚Äù"
"Several Republicans have called for a bipartisan effort with health care, but the prospects aren‚Äôt looking too rosy."

No vacation when there's a repeal effort to be had.
A truly remarkable self-own.
And then she refused to get into any more detail about it.
Does anybody really have time to read entire emails anymore?
"Yes, duped into agreeing to a meeting he was explicitly told was part of the Russian government‚Äôs efforts to help his dad's campaign."
Buckle up.
"Oh, and Hillary Clinton!"
Marshall: ‚ÄúThe critical addition of the Don Jr. meeting fits right into a critical period when what we understand were Russian intelligence operatives were trying various vehicles to surface emails that were stolen during the spring last year.‚Äù
"‚ÄúI tracked down sources. Followed so many dead leads. Labored over this. And then, he just, you know, tweeted out the proof.‚Äù"
‚ÄúThis is going to require a lot of questions to be asked and answered.‚Äù
"Highlight: ‚ÄúThis is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump."""
In which Trump Jr. posits that the only reason the media would be interested in his meeting with someone linked to a foreign adversary to get dirt on a political opponent is ‚Äúdesperation.‚Äù
Something about Trump Jr.‚Äôs story and the lawyer‚Äôs isn‚Äôt quite adding up here.
Marshall: ‚ÄúWe are now into the territory not of ‚Äòwas there collusion or contact?‚Äô but 'how substantial was it?'‚Äù
Let the voter purging begin.

A cool half a billion dollars.
This trend only started about a year ago.
‚ÄúWould Comey have been incautious enough to leak classified information in such a high profile setting in which he was essentially going to war with the President of the United States? I very much doubt it.‚Äù
Well then.
"Unfortunately for Bannon, things didn‚Äôt quite go his way."
"Yep, we‚Äôre back to Comey‚Äôs ‚Äúillegal‚Äù leaks again."
"Did you expect him to what, NOT get juicy Clinton intel from a lawyer linked to a foreign adversary?"

"‚ÄúWe have a growing number of stories like these, each seemingly damning but which we are told are mere coincidences and misunderstandings with no connection to any of the other stories. It‚Äôs just not credible.‚Äù"

"I will be talking more about my friend's book, but this is a preview of why it's so good."
Sounds like this kid held up well against a typical left-wing indoctrination session at school.
I've found that every time Trump has a good moment -- be it advancing his agenda or a great speech -- it isn't long before in the media something pops up that is of a controversial nature that is designed to cover and overwhelm the good story.

"If this Natalia ""Natasha Fatale"" Veselnitskaya was so hot to help Trump, why was she posting anti-Trump pictures on Facebook, showing him as Putin's baby?"

"Hillary Clinton is seen as a joke. If Putin wanted anybody to win this election, it would have been Hillary Clinton, because with Hillary, Putin is closer to where he wants to get than ever. It'd be like a continuation of Obama, who was totally deferential to Putin."
"The real truth about the United States and slavery is that we ended it.  The United States of America was one of the first nations in history to end slavery, and 500,000 plus Americans lost their lives in the process.  It was called the Civil War.

"The G20 rioters are anti-capitalist leftists.  Many of them (you would be amazed at how many) are trust fund kids from all over the world.  Many of them are the children of the wealthy in Europe, in the United States, and they are there because they have this guilt and this aimlessness in life."
"Putin knows damn well he did not collude to ensure Trump's victory.  Putin knows damn well he had nothing to do with the outcome of our election, and he knows that he needs Trump.  He knows that he needs a good relationship with the United States as his country sputters from high energy costs, sanctions, low employment. You have been so lied to about this. We all have."
"Have you heard Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton or Nancy Pelosi or Chuck You Schumer or any leftist -- any Democrat in our country -- demand an end to the rioting, the property destruction, the threats and the violence and the lies of these leftists?  Have you seen the left attempt to reform itself?"
"Jeff, I cannot thank you enough. As I say, you‚Äôve made my day, and I‚Äôm so happy you‚Äôre out there."
What Trump did today with his speech in Poland ‚Äî the whole thing is awesome.
"I've been making this claim since this program began. When people would call here and ask me to explain a particular movement on the left or this or that, I would say what you're seeing is a bunch of people seeking to have normalcy or normality redefined so that it includes them."
"It's unbelievable to watch what this collection of people claiming to be journalists is doing to themselves.  It's a circular firing squad.  They're shooting themselves in the foot. They're setting themselves on fire, and they're doing it all with righteous indignation at a man they hate running intellectual and tactical rings around them."

What if the real reason for the meeting is for Trump and Putin to complete the mission? The final destruction.
"Donald Trump is taking on the American media as so many millions of Americans have longed for, have hoped for, and have wished for -- and to some, it feels uncomfortable. It makes them a little nervous."
"You know, it always amazes me what happens on this program that‚Äôs gonna get picked up and broadcast all over everywhere else in the media. And there are two things. Yesterday on this program I offered the opinion that Trump may in fact spell the end of CNN.  The other thing that has captivated the Drive-Bys is my comparison of little Jim Acosta at CNN to my little cat chasing a red laser pointer. That has captivated people. I mean, they‚Äôve written about it; they have spoken about it. It‚Äôs just a little analogy. I mean, you have a cat, if you have a cat. It doesn‚Äôt matter, kitten or cat ‚Äî and they never catch on to it, it‚Äôs the most amazing thing ‚Äî grab a red laser pointer and point it near the cat on the floor, on the wall, or on the side of the sofa, and the cat will try to catch it."

"You could make the case that several Republicans are victims of Stockholm Syndrome. They have just simply become friends with their captors and have sought to become friends and sought to quell the anger of their captors, i.e., the Drive-By Media."

And Good Riddance.‚Äù Good-bye nonpartisan? When did we ever have that?"
They‚Äôve shot everything they‚Äôve got at Trump and Trump‚Äôs still there and the momentum is starting to turn.
"Have you ever had a pet cat and one of these red laser pointers? You point it at the floor, and the cat tries to catch it. You point it up against the sofa, cat runs into the sofa. You point it against the wall, cat runs into the wall.  I think that's what the Trump administration is doing with many in the media."
"This is akin to saying that a thousand prisoners who escape are now homeless. Do you think the prisoners care? They just got out of prison, they just escaped but we‚Äôre gonna call ‚Äôem homeless because they‚Äôre not in prison anymore."
"You know Trump could appoint another independent counsel to investigate Mueller?  Now, before you start snickering, there is a period of time where Mueller may have been colluding with Comey before Mueller was named the independent counsel.  Who knows? Mueller may have been involved in Comey in leaking certain things."
"Something's shifting that the momentum, if you will. The left seems to be losing some of their momentum."
There has been no question that Trump was totally constitutionally within his rights to issue this travel ban.
"The purpose of the travel ban is not the travel ban.  The purpose of the ban is to prevent massive immigration by refugees and others while new vetting procedures are explored, concocted, and implemented.  And the travel ban anticipates 90 to 120 days to do that."
The minimum wage is hastening the use of technology. Plain and simple.

"Might I point out that this James Hodgkinson shooting is the second act such as this that has been created by a Bernie Sanders supporter?  There was an incident on a train in Oregon recently. It was not covered much by the Drive-By Media, but that, too, that act was perpetrated by a Bernie Sanders supporter."
"James Hodgkinson was not some lunatic fringe wacko that storms into a movie theater.  He was deranged, don't misunderstand.  But he was dead focused on policy -- which makes this even more disturbing to me, if that makes sense to you.  The fact that he is a devoted leftist that is up to speed on policy and can recite verbatim what he hears spoken by people he admires and the media and the Democrat Party? That's what I think heralds the identity of the modern-day left, the media and the Democrat Party."
"It's a very dangerous time, a very precarious balance that we have in the country today, and it's all because a political party cannot come to grips with losing.  Not just this last election but losing the House and losing the Senate.  The Democrats just can't come to grips with it."

"It is crystal clear that these leaks -- it's been clear for a while -- were part of a targeted, silent coup, a political assassination of the Donald Trump administration and presidency. No question about it."
Trump was sent to Washington to drain the swamp. He was sent there to clean the place out. He was sent there to turn things upside down.
"At some point, these people in the left's lunatic base are gonna crack, and they're not gonna just start cutting heads off of dolls, and they're not gonna just start using fake knives to stab people in Central Park."
The only evidence that we have of obstruction happens to be Loretta Lynch's attempt to obstruct the investigation into Hillary Clinton.  The only evidence we have of an election being rigged is the Democrat primary.

David Axelrod says, ‚ÄúIt is not unusual ‚Äî if you live in North Korea. ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never seen anything like this.‚Äù. . That‚Äôs the point folks!. . That is precisely the point."
"Everybody's tired of the predictable, formulaic things that are said and done in Washington.  Trump was sent there to shake things up.  He's doing it, and he's not backing off from doing it."
"Meanwhile, in the U.S. Senate, the Republicans got the go-ahead to use reconciliation to repeal Obamacare, just as the Democrats used that maneuver to force this disaster down America's throats."
"The opponents of President Trump saw this fake, phony, made-up Russian dossier about the golden showers and thought: Hey, this looks believable enough. We can use it to smear Trump!"
"This Comey fellow comes off to me as a snake a lot of times, and it seems to me ‚Äî looking at this from my purely fair and objective vantage point ‚Äî that he sides with Democrats practically all the time, even though he‚Äôs been in Republican administrations. He sided with Hillary. He didn‚Äôt want to do anything with Loretta Lynch, even though she made him nervous."

"Female writers ‚Äî New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times ‚Äî all claim they saw exactly what they see when a woman is sexually harassed in the workplace. (interruption) They are totally off it. Comey was the power structure. This is why, you know, I‚Äôm asking myself: Are these people genuinely this stupid?"
"This is what happens when there‚Äôs nobody within the close circle that can give ideological advice, ‚Äôcause I don‚Äôt think they even understand where this level of viciousness is coming from. It‚Äôs not just they oppose that Trump won; it‚Äôs not just they oppose the fact he‚Äôs president. It‚Äôs not just the fact that they oppose him being in the Oval Office. It goes far, far deeper than that and it‚Äôs much more personal than that, and it matters to understand it in dealing with it."
"When Comey announced that he leaked, some people thought, ""Yeah, he had to feel guilty.""  No way.  He didn't feel guilty.  He wanted a badge!  He wanted a badge of honor.  He wanted a medal for leaking."
"They renamed the annual Gay Pride March in Los Angeles to The Resist March.  Do you know what it takes to take ""gay"" out of the title of something?  When you're having the gay pride march and they take ""gay"" out of it and replace it with the ""resistance,"" they are really ticked off."
"Shortly after Trump was inaugurated, the Democrats had these massive protests (bought and paid for by George Soros) all over the country, and their signs said ""Love Trumps Hate."" I'll tell you what: All I'm seeing is hate. Period.  I don't see any love from these people on the left."

"Trump was never being investigated, and we've got an independent counsel? Whisky Tango Foxtrot, folks.  Whisky Tango Foxtrot? What the heck is going on?"
"It's the president that runs the executive branch, and if anybody answers to anybody, it's the FBI director answers to the president.  The president cannot ""obstruct,"" by definition of the Constitution. The president cannot obstruct the FBI director. He can order him around.  He can tell me him to do this, not do that."
"The media are now being defined and governed by a raw, sheer hatred -- and this is important: That hatred is combined with daily affirmation that the best they've got to get rid of Donald Trump is not working."
"Believe none of what you see and half of what you hear on social media -- and check everything.  That is what I do with practically anything now, but particularly with Twitter and Facebook."
"Do you realize the entire Senate and House intelligence communities have known since January -- since Comey's first appearance up there, whenever it was -- that Trump was not under investigation?  Every damn Democrat for the last four months has known this.  So have a lot of Republicans."
"After yesterday, nothing changes.  The people that hate Trump are still there and the people that love Trump are still there, and the people that love Trump are becoming more and more hated."
"Donald Trump is hanging in there and making it look like none of this affects him. When the girlie boys of Washington come after you, you are supposed to cower in the corner and have a spine made of linguini. You're not supposed to act like King Kong."
"In the past two years, nothing the media, the Democrats, the Washington establishment, and the Never Trumpers have thrown at Trump has worked. They have thrown everything they've got at Trump, and he is still there."
"The Washington, D.C. -- and actually the global -- establishment is attempting to undermine the current president.  There is a very loud, silent coup underway, and all of this has an objective, and that is to either paralyze the Trump presidency or to dispatch it."
It was just five months ago the Democrats hated this guy and wanted him dead!

No obstruction of justice and no attempt by Trump to shape this investigation one way or the other. There is no reason why we are even here.
"We're living literally a soap opera, the script of which is being put together daily by elements of the media and the Washington establishment -- and it's built on nothing.  It literally is built on nothing."
"I have been somewhat disappointed in the squishiness of Republican senators in this hearing today, and then I had to catch myself and realize they don't like Trump.  They have no brief for Trump.  Half of them are running around salivating President Pence."
"James Comey admitted under oath -- and we had it yesterday in the prerelease of his testimony -- that Donald Trump did not ask him to stop the Russian investigation.  Therefore, there is no obstruction of justice."
"Former FBI director -- the admitted coward -- James Comey, afraid to be in a room alone with Donald Trump, is giving ammunition to both sides here.  He made sure to drop some news on what he thought of Loretta Lynch trying to get him to change the name of the investigation to a ""matter.""  The bottom line: Nothing's gonna change."
"Maybe it is that the Republicans in the House and the Senate are not convinced that Trump‚Äôs gonna survive and they‚Äôre holding their fire and they‚Äôre keeping their powder dry in the event that Trump doesn‚Äôt make it, either resigns, is impeached, is forced out by the media, or whatever, maybe they‚Äôre holding out to find out if Trump will survive all this."
"Scott Adams, the Dilbert cartoonist, suggested this months ago. He says Trump thinks in terms of persuasion, so he came up with the same idea."
"Many people mistakenly believe that this is the theme song for the movie Men in Black.  Well, it was adapted for Men in Black, but the actual song is Forget Me Nots by Patrice Rushen and the Men in Black franchise paid to use it."

"Absent critical thinking, you will simply believe anything anybody says, particularly if it's written down.  If it's written anywhere -- if it's written on the internet, if it's written in the newspaper, if it's written in a magazine -- there's a tendency to automatically believe it."

California Democrats attempted to silence Maxine Waters. The head of the California Democratic Party African-American caucus is now angry about it and wants to know why Maxine Waters was cut off during the California state Democrat convention when she was making her speech.
"He reached back to make sure she was there, and she gave what was the equivalent of a fist bump. He reaches back, ‚ÄúAre you there?‚Äù She touches his hand to let him know she‚Äôs there; everything‚Äôs fine. She did not slap his hand away."
"The terrorist stuff that I have today is mostly idiotic reactions to it.  As I said at the opening of the program, it's gotten to the point that this is a pattern.  Terrorism happens and everybody says, ""Oh, it's so horrible,"" and they pray and they express sympathy for the victims and their families; then they go away.  Nobody does anything about it."
"This is just something that we‚Äôre gonna have to put up with from now on because it doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs any effort to stop it. And whenever anybody attempts to mount a serious effort to stop it, they‚Äôre slapped down."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is a protocol rule that the president of the United States is always the first through any doorway, including wives, spouses, mistresses, daughters, any other women. The president goes through every doorway first.  You know who told me this?  Trump! You know how I know this?  It's because he was apologizing for going before my wife through a doorway one day."
It's just pathetic.
"It may not be quite politic to comment on it 'cause I could easily be misunderstood, but I'm gonna give it a whirl."

"For more than twenty years, Bill Maher has set the boundaries of where funny, political talk can go on American television.  First on ‚ÄúPolitically Incorrect‚Äù (Comedy Central, ABC, 1993-2002), and for the last fourteen years on HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúReal Time,‚Äù Maher‚Äôs combination of unflinching honesty and big laughs have garnered him 38 Emmy nominations.  Maher won his first Emmy in 2014 as executive producer for the HBO series, ‚ÄúVICE.‚Äù In October of 2008, this same combination was on display in Maher‚Äôs uproarious and unprecedented swipe at organized religion, ‚ÄúReligulous,‚Äù directed by Larry Charles (‚ÄúBorat‚Äù). The documentary has gone on to become the 8th Highest Grossing Documentary ever.. . In addition to his television program ‚Äì which has featured such visitors as President Barack Obama, Vice President Joseph Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kerry Washington, Michael Steele, Howard Dean, Michael Moore, Eva Longoria, Drew Barrymore,  Rev. Jesse Jackson, Gen. Wesley Clark, Susan Sarandon, Kevin Costner, Gary Hart and Pat Buchanan.‚Äì Maher has written five bestsellers: ‚ÄúTrue Story,‚Äù ‚ÄúDoes Anybody Have a Problem with That?  Politically Incorrect‚Äôs Greatest Hits,‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen You Ride Alone, You Ride with Bin Laden,‚Äù ‚ÄúNew Rules: Polite Musings from a Timid Observer,‚Äù and most recently, ‚ÄúThe New New Rules: A Funny Look at How Everybody But  Me Has Their Head Up Their Ass.‚Äù. . Maher started his career as a stand-up comedian in 1979, and still performs at least fifty dates a year in Las Vegas and in sold out theaters all across the country.  Four of his ten stand-up specials for HBO ‚Äì 2014‚Äôs ‚ÄúBill Maher: Live from DC,‚Äù 2007‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Decider,‚Äù 2005‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Swiss,‚Äù as well as the hilarious, ‚ÄúBill Maher ‚Ä¶ But I‚Äôm Not Wrong,‚Äù ‚Äì have been nominated for Emmy awards.  . .

Scientists, in general, are wary of making blanket statements about the effect climate change has on any weather event. Heat waves, after all, aren't that unusual. But there have been measurable increases in both frequency and intensity of heat waves in recent decades, and they are the weather phenomenon most closely linked to climate change. In one recent study, Stanford researchers used observations and models to quantify how much human-caused global warming influenced the hottest day and month on record in different parts of the globe. In more than 80 percent of the area for which observations were available, climate change played a role. http://trib.al/H6euequ"

"From the Monitor's Eva Botkin-Kowacki: ""It's kind of dangerous,"" Steve Perlman told me over the phone in a tone of voice that must have been accompanied by a shrug.. He had just told me about a time in the Marquesas Islands when he had rappelled off a cliff looking for rare plants but misjudged the distance to the bottom and the stability of the rock from which he dangled. There he was, at the end of a 160-foot rope, spinning around in midair, small rocks pelting his helmet and shoulders, with a 20 to 30-foot drop to the ground below him. Because Perlman's field partner was too far away to hear him yell, ""I just had to bite the bullet and work my way back up the whole line,"" he recalls.. ""It's just the nature of this extreme botany that we're doing,"" Perlman says. ""You're all the way out there, so you just want to keep going, you don't want to be stopped by a waterfall, you want to see what plants are on those steep cliffs ... you're not thinking you're going to die."".
