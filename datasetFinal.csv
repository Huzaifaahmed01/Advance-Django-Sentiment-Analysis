Nehlen shows why the populist, nationalist struggle and the Trump administration will center on trade and provides the invaluable perspective of an international businessman who came to champion America First.

Be sure to read Rev. Peterson's ""The Antidote: Healing America From the Poison of Hate, Blame and Victimhood."" Get it here --> http://amzn.to/2tIPrZ6. . For a half century or more, black people have labored under the spell of what Jesse Lee Peterson calls the alchemists. These are the race hustlers, media hacks, politicians, community organizers and the like who promise to fundamentally transform America. . . The transformation they promise, however, produces only fool s gold unearned benefits like welfare, food stamps, subsidized housing, payouts from lawsuits, and maybe one day even reparations. Worse, to secure these counterfeit goods, recipients have to sacrifice something of infinite value: the sanctity of the two-parent family. It is a devil s bargain. . . To make this experiment work, the alchemists have created an ungodly and unhealthy environment, one in which the white population is made to feel guilty and the black population made to feel angry. The pattern in this is simple: children black or white when deprived of fathers, grow up angry at their parents. White children displace their anger in a thousand different directions. Black children channel theirs, for the most part, in a single destructive direction towards and against white people. . . The alchemists encourage them to do this, enable them, and even reward them. This anger fuels the system and pays the alchemists bills. As bleak as this all sounds, an antidote exists, which saved Peterson s life, that of his son, and those of countless young men who have been counseled at Peterson s organization, BOND. The perverse genius of liberalism has been its ability to capture black anger and project it outwards towards anyone, black or white, who resists the Democratic agenda. . . By encouraging a resentful dependency, liberals have instituted a new kind of slavery in the black community as emotionally shackling as the physical slavery that first brought Africans to America. Peterson knows this story from the inside as few other people do. . . Born on an Alabama plantation, he was abandoned by his father before he was born. After high school, Peterson moved to Los Angeles and for the next twenty years moved purposelessly through life, channeling his internal anger outwards towards white people and America in general.

Nehlen's run presaged the international movement against globalism which reached its climax with the election of President Donald Trump. It's a firsthand look at the development of one of the original Trump Republicans and the populist message which is sending shockwaves through the Beltway Right.. . In Wage the Battle, Paul Nehlen takes you inside his quixotic campaign and shows how this David vs. Goliath political struggle inspired patriotic activists around the nation. He also tells the story of how his primary challenge, though unsuccessful, ultimately helped beat the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), the international trade deal once described by Hillary Clinton as the gold standard for trade and a policy goal for both the Republican and Democrat Establishments. Nehlen shows why the populist, nationalist struggle and the Trump administration will center on trade and provides the invaluable perspective of an international businessman who came to champion America First. He also throws down the gauntlet at the feet of Paul Ryan, accusing the Speaker of being a corporate crony career politician who is selling out his constituents.. .  ‚Äî Products shown: Wage the Battle: Putting America First  and American Greatness: How Conservatism Inc.

"Antifa's Rights Are Terminated . . It‚Äôs simple, it is a criminal offense to organize, or be a member of a group that advocates the violent overthrow of the U.S. government.. . A Federal Law known as the Smith Act was passed in 1940. Following World War 2, the act was used to break up the leadership of the Communist Party USA leaders. Ten of those Communist Party members were given 5 years and a $10,000 fine.. . In 1954 President Eisenhower signed the Communist Control Act, outlawing the Communist Party of the United States. Essentially criminalizing support for the party or ‚Äúcommunist-action‚Äù organizations.. . 50 USC 842 states ‚ÄúThe Communist Party of the United States, or any successors of such party regardless of the assumed name, whose object or purpose is to overthrow the Government of the United States, or the government of any State, Territory, District, or possession thereof, or the government of any political subdivision therein by force and violence, are not entitled to any of the rights, privileges, and immunities attendant upon legal bodies created under the jurisdiction of the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof; and whatever rights, privileges, and immunities which have heretofore been granted to said party or any subsidiary organization by reason of the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof, are terminated"". . These laws are still on the books. Simply put. Violent George Soros funded affinity groups or Antifa groups utilizing the anarchist tactics known as ‚Äúswarming‚Äù as defined by the RAND Corporation based in the tenets of Communism wielded on the average citizen of the United States of America have forfeited their rights. The tax dollars shoveled into the overtime pay for local police to allow Antifa to express first Amendment rights that are forfeit under federal laws that go back 77 years are invalid and illegal. There is a larger problem here. Our tax dollars are being unlawfully used against us.. .
