Their discovery has also meant the virtual eradication of a type of stomach cancer caused by helicobacter infection.

Generally, a person may be punished for sedition only when he or she makes statements that create a Clear and Present Danger to rights that the government may lawfully protect.  A person found guilty of seditious conspiracy or advocating the overthrow of the government may be fined and sentenced to up to 20 years in prison. States also maintain laws that punish similar advocacy and conspiracy against the state government.

He was approached and offered a job to fly for Air America which was later revealed to be a dummy corporation for the CIA. Kiyosaki ultimately turned the offer down.

Stirring up quite a bit of controversy, Kiyosaki conducted a second interview with Millie Weaver to go further down the rabbit hole – expounding upon his prior statement – revealing even more run-ins with the CIA in 1966 during the Vietnam War.",2,3,240,8,1,25

"After their first child, Noah, was diagnosed in 2009 with Batten disease, a deadly childhood illness, Tracy and Jen VanHoutan began a tireless quest to save their son.

They worked internationally with scientists to find therapies where none existed, lobbied Congress and the FDA, and helped raise more than $1.5 million in the search for a cure.

Earlier this year, the unrelenting efforts of the suburban Chicago couple paid off when the FDA approved the first known drug found to dramatically slow the effects of Batten disease. 

""I can honestly say it wouldn't have happened if it weren't for them,"" said Julia Jenkins, executive director of the EveryLife Foundation for Rare Diseases.
 
Sadly, for the VanHoutans, it didn't happen fast enough.

Noah Scott VanHoutan died in March 2016, just shy of his 12th birthday. And Laine VanHoutan, now 11, is in hospice care. 

""We prayed for a miracle,"" said Jacqueline Farnaus, Jen VanHoutan's mother. ""Maybe the miracle for Noah and Laine happened in a different way. Maybe it's that they were the saviors for other kids.""",0,0,84,26,39,0

"#WageTheBattle with Paul Nehlen, who is challenging Paul Ryan again in the GOP Primary!

Watch the MUST SEE trailer for Paul Nehlen upcoming book, ""Wage the Battle: Putting America First in the Fight to Stop Globalist Politicians and Secure the Borders""

Order it here --> http://amzn.to/2tXeVCq

""In his heart, you know President Trump wanted to endorse Paul Nehlen."" --Ann Coulter, Bestselling Author

Wage the Battle is a call to action. It is the amazing story of how self-described manufacturing guy Paul Nehlen took on Speaker of the House Paul Ryan in one of the most closely followed congressional races in the nation. Nehlen's run presaged the international movement against globalism which reached its climax with the election of President Donald Trump. It's a firsthand look at the development of one of the original Trump Republicans and the populist message which is sending shockwaves through the Beltway Right.

In Wage the Battle, Paul Nehlen takes you inside his quixotic campaign and shows how this David vs. Goliath political struggle inspired patriotic activists around the nation. He also tells the story of how his primary challenge, though unsuccessful, ultimately helped beat the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), the international trade deal once described by Hillary Clinton as the gold standard for trade and a policy goal for both the Republican and Democrat Establishments. Nehlen shows why the populist, nationalist struggle and the Trump administration will center on trade and provides the invaluable perspective of an international businessman who came to champion America First. He also throws down the gauntlet at the feet of Paul Ryan, accusing the Speaker of being a corporate crony career politician who is selling out his constituents.

Be sure to read Rev. Peterson's ""The Antidote: Healing America From the Poison of Hate, Blame and Victimhood."" Get it here --> http://amzn.to/2tIPrZ6

For a half century or more, black people have labored under the spell of what Jesse Lee Peterson calls the alchemists. These are the race hustlers, media hacks, politicians, community organizers and the like who promise to fundamentally transform America. 

The transformation they promise, however, produces only fool s gold unearned benefits like welfare, food stamps, subsidized housing, payouts from lawsuits, and maybe one day even reparations. Worse, to secure these counterfeit goods, recipients have to sacrifice something of infinite value: the sanctity of the two-parent family. It is a devil s bargain. 

To make this experiment work, the alchemists have created an ungodly and unhealthy environment, one in which the white population is made to feel guilty and the black population made to feel angry. The pattern in this is simple: children black or white when deprived of fathers, grow up angry at their parents. White children displace their anger in a thousand different directions. Black children channel theirs, for the most part, in a single destructive direction towards and against white people. 

The alchemists encourage them to do this, enable them, and even reward them. This anger fuels the system and pays the alchemists bills. As bleak as this all sounds, an antidote exists, which saved Peterson s life, that of his son, and those of countless young men who have been counseled at Peterson s organization, BOND. The perverse genius of liberalism has been its ability to capture black anger and project it outwards towards anyone, black or white, who resists the Democratic agenda. 

By encouraging a resentful dependency, liberals have instituted a new kind of slavery in the black community as emotionally shackling as the physical slavery that first brought Africans to America. Peterson knows this story from the inside as few other people do. 

Born on an Alabama plantation, he was abandoned by his father before he was born. After high school, Peterson moved to Los Angeles and for the next twenty years moved purposelessly through life, channeling his internal anger outwards towards white people and America in general. In the mission he has undertaken since, and in this hopeful book, Peterson shares what he learned on his personal road to Damascus.

Get it here --> http://amzn.to/2ps4qDS

“This book will scare you. This book will open your eyes. This book will shake you. What this book says is frightening,” said retired Lt. Gen. William G. Boykin.

Listen to the incredible interview of Chris Gaubatz talking to Carl Gallups about when he infiltrated CAIR to try and expose the plans of the  Muslim Brotherhood in America. 

You've heard about the courageous young investigators who covertly videotaped officials of ACORN advocating illegal activities. Now, get ready for an undercover expose even more daring: a six-month penetration of the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations that resulted in the collection of thousands of pages of smoking-gun documents from this terror-supporting front group for the dangerous, mob-like Muslim Brotherhood. 

This is what Muslim Mafia delivers. 

It has all the elements of a top-flight mystery novel, but the situations and conversations are real. The book's frightening allegations are supported by more than 12,000 pages of confidential CAIR documents and hundreds of hours of video captured in an unprecedented undercover operation. This trail of information reveals the seditious and well-funded efforts of the Brotherhood under the nonprofit guise of CAIR to support the international jihad against the U.S.

""American Greatness: How Conservatism Inc. Missed the 2016 Election and What the D.C. Establishment Needs to Learn"" by Chris Buskirk, Seth Leibsohn and with a foreword by William J. Bennett 

Pre-order here --> http://amzn.to/2tJ7vCH

How is it possible that the conservative elite, Washington insiders, and mainstream media were so completely out of touch with reality during the 2016 US presidential election cycle?

""We were all wrong!"" ""The greatest political upset in our lifetime."" ""None of us saw this coming"" are just a few of the confessions pundits, experts, and anchors expressed when it emerged that Donald J. Trump was the winner. Yet, while most of the political establishment and pundits missed the boat, there were many who recognized the growing Trump phenomenon in early spring 2016. And there were some who recognized, even during every seeming Trump-created ""meltdown"" or ""mistake,"" that Donald Trump not only could win, but would win. What did they see that others didn't? More importantly, how could so many ""experts"" and ""smart people"" get the election so totally wrong? And why are they still considered experts?

American Greatness is an analysis and indictment of the mainstream media, liberal commentariat, and conservative establishment that implicitly undermined, if not insulted, some 60 million fellow Americans when they treated Donald Trump's candidacy as a sideshow. With so little humility or self-reflection and no apology! How can these so-called experts continue reporting on and analyzing a country and polity they have essentially admitted they do not understand? After all, what they got wrong in 2016 was not just an election. What they got wrong was America.

One writer pegged it when he compared the election to the fateful Flight 93, which was thwarted by brave Americans who sacrificed their lives to stop the terrorists. The profound essay exposed the hypocrisy of the checklist conservatives and deflated the Never-Trump movement. He recognized that Trump represented something new the spirit of Americans. The 2016 election was the Flight 93 election. It was a take charge or die situation. For most Americans choosing Hillary Clinton would have been like playing Russian Roulette with a semi-automatic. With Trump at least we had better odds.

Get it here --> http://amzn.to/2s6sAm1

Wage the Battle is a call to action. It is the amazing story of how self-described manufacturing guy Paul Nehlen took on Speaker of the House Paul Ryan in one of the most closely followed congressional races in the nation. Nehlen's run presaged the international movement against globalism which reached its climax with the election of President Donald Trump. It's a firsthand look at the development of one of the original Trump Republicans and the populist message which is sending shockwaves through the Beltway Right.

In Wage the Battle, Paul Nehlen takes you inside his quixotic campaign and shows how this David vs. Goliath political struggle inspired patriotic activists around the nation. He also tells the story of how his primary challenge, though unsuccessful, ultimately helped beat the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), the international trade deal once described by Hillary Clinton as the gold standard for trade and a policy goal for both the Republican and Democrat Establishments. Nehlen shows why the populist, nationalist struggle and the Trump administration will center on trade and provides the invaluable perspective of an international businessman who came to champion America First. He also throws down the gauntlet at the feet of Paul Ryan, accusing the Speaker of being a corporate crony career politician who is selling out his constituents.

-What went wrong for the pundits and what they missed
-How America first is simply common sense
-How checklist conservatism failed America
-Who the media should be listening to
-How it s time to relearn the basics
-And much more

American Greatness is not just another analysis of the mainstream media's liberal biases. It focuses equally on the many conservative writers, thinkers, and pundits who profoundly missed the mark as well. American Greatness explains how the timing was perfect for a populist takeover, why both the Left and the Right missed the pulse of the nation, and, most important, how we can move forward to truly make America great again.

Dropping the gauntlet on American media sites including Infowars, Drudge Report, and Breitbart that for reasons completely alien to her and the rest of the radical left, support our present commander in chief Donald Trump.

Weintraub is following Time magazine's lead, claiming that Russian money bought political ads on Facebook. Thus, alternative media must be in Putin's pocket as well.

Weintraub's FEC Memorandum states ""This is an all-hands-on-deck moment for our democracy. Former Vice President DickCheney has said that Russia's alleged actions could be considered ""an act of war"" against the United States. Every part of our government that has jurisdiction over these issues must exercise every scrap of its jurisdiction as it can.""

Weintraub told Politico, ""if there are U.S. citizens involved in any way in spending foreign money to influence a U.S. election, then that would be something that we could and should pursue.""

Of course, the hubris and hypocrisy doesn't fall far from the Democratic tree. Weintraub should know all about foreign donations and influence, she thrives on them.

The Daily Caller reports"" Since 2002, the Federal Election Commission’s three Democratic members took at least 50 official trips during their combined time serving on the agency, according to documents obtained from public records and Freedom of Information Act requests. Expenses related to the trips were paid by a combination of foreign groups, governments, and by U.S. taxpayers through the agency’s own budget.

Records reveal Weintraub has taken at least 30 foreign trips since she joined the agency in 2003. The non-profit International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), for instance, paid more than $9000 for Weintraub to spend over a week in Indonesia. In another instance, Weintraub met Socialist leaders for a gourmet meal in Albania. Her trips also included junkets to the Philippines, Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador.",12,43,196,1,0,18

"The Growing Sedition Of Linda Sarsour

Due to the broad and ironclad protections of the first Amendment, A charge of sedition against a U.S. citizen is extremely rare. Nevertheless, sedition remains a crime in the United States under 18 U.S.C.A. § 2384 (2000), a federal statute that punishes seditious conspiracy, and 18 U.S.C.A. § 2385 (2000), which outlaws advocating the overthrow of the federal government by force. Generally, a person may be punished for sedition only when he or she makes statements that create a Clear and Present Danger to rights that the government may lawfully protect.  A person found guilty of seditious conspiracy or advocating the overthrow of the government may be fined and sentenced to up to 20 years in prison. States also maintain laws that punish similar advocacy and conspiracy against the state government.

"Antifa's Rights Are Terminated 

It’s simple, it is a criminal offense to organize, or be a member of a group that advocates the violent overthrow of the U.S. government.

A Federal Law known as the Smith Act was passed in 1940. Following World War 2, the act was used to break up the leadership of the Communist Party USA leaders. Ten of those Communist Party members were given 5 years and a $10,000 fine.

In 1954 President Eisenhower signed the Communist Control Act, outlawing the Communist Party of the United States. Essentially criminalizing support for the party or “communist-action” organizations.

50 USC 842 states “The Communist Party of the United States, or any successors of such party regardless of the assumed name, whose object or purpose is to overthrow the Government of the United States, or the government of any State, Territory, District, or possession thereof, or the government of any political subdivision therein by force and violence, are not entitled to any of the rights, privileges, and immunities attendant upon legal bodies created under the jurisdiction of the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof; and whatever rights, privileges, and immunities which have heretofore been granted to said party or any subsidiary organization by reason of the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof, are terminated""

These laws are still on the books. Simply put. Violent George Soros funded affinity groups or Antifa groups utilizing the anarchist tactics known as “swarming” as defined by the RAND Corporation based in the tenets of Communism wielded on the average citizen of the United States of America have forfeited their rights. The tax dollars shoveled into the overtime pay for local police to allow Antifa to express first Amendment rights that are forfeit under federal laws that go back 77 years are invalid and illegal. There is a larger problem here. Our tax dollars are being unlawfully used against us.

"For more than twenty years, Bill Maher has set the boundaries of where funny, political talk can go on American television.  First on “Politically Incorrect” (Comedy Central, ABC, 1993-2002), and for the last fourteen years on HBO’s “Real Time,” Maher’s combination of unflinching honesty and big laughs have garnered him 38 Emmy nominations.  Maher won his first Emmy in 2014 as executive producer for the HBO series, “VICE.” In October of 2008, this same combination was on display in Maher’s uproarious and unprecedented swipe at organized religion, “Religulous,” directed by Larry Charles (“Borat”). The documentary has gone on to become the 8th Highest Grossing Documentary ever.

In addition to his television program – which has featured such visitors as President Barack Obama, Vice President Joseph Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kerry Washington, Michael Steele, Howard Dean, Michael Moore, Eva Longoria, Drew Barrymore,  Rev. Jesse Jackson, Gen. Wesley Clark, Susan Sarandon, Kevin Costner, Gary Hart and Pat Buchanan.– Maher has written five bestsellers: “True Story,” “Does Anybody Have a Problem with That?  Politically Incorrect’s Greatest Hits,” “When You Ride Alone, You Ride with Bin Laden,” “New Rules: Polite Musings from a Timid Observer,” and most recently, “The New New Rules: A Funny Look at How Everybody But  Me Has Their Head Up Their Ass.”

Maher started his career as a stand-up comedian in 1979, and still performs at least fifty dates a year in Las Vegas and in sold out theaters all across the country.  Four of his ten stand-up specials for HBO – 2014’s “Bill Maher: Live from DC,” 2007’s “The Decider,” 2005’s “I’m Swiss,” as well as the hilarious, “Bill Maher … But I’m Not Wrong,” – have been nominated for Emmy awards.  

Maher was born in New York City, raised in River Vale, N.J. and went to Cornell University.  He now resides in Los Angeles.",0,18,1017,124,0,3

But there have been measurable increases in both frequency and intensity of heat waves in recent decades, and they are the weather phenomenon most closely linked to climate change.

"From the Monitor's Eva Botkin-Kowacki: ""It's kind of dangerous,"" Steve Perlman told me over the phone in a tone of voice that must have been accompanied by a shrug.
He had just told me about a time in the Marquesas Islands when he had rappelled off a cliff looking for rare plants but misjudged the distance to the bottom and the stability of the rock from which he dangled. There he was, at the end of a 160-foot rope, spinning around in midair, small rocks pelting his helmet and shoulders, with a 20 to 30-foot drop to the ground below him. Because Perlman's field partner was too far away to hear him yell, ""I just had to bite the bullet and work my way back up the whole line,"" he recalls.
""It's just the nature of this extreme botany that we're doing,"" Perlman says. ""You're all the way out there, so you just want to keep going, you don't want to be stopped by a waterfall, you want to see what plants are on those steep cliffs ... you're not thinking you're going to die.""
I met Perlman during a journalism fellowship with the National Tropical Botanical Garden on the Hawaiian island of Kauai in May. Perlman’s brand of extreme botany, as part of the Plant Extinction Prevention Program in Hawaii, is just one example of the heroic conservation efforts going on around the globe. But not everyone agrees on the best way to save the vast amount of the natural world under threat.
